ScheduleBot:

Algorithm:
1.) Get info from Students (what they've taken, when they plan on graduating, current time (quarter/year) )
2.) Make Schedule (~2 math classes per quarter if possible)
	a.) Fill in Requirements
		i.) can fill in quarter by quarter, 2 at a time if prereqs are satisfied, then can go back after if need be (like say someone needs to take 3 classes in a quarter to graduate)
	b.) Fill in Electives
		ii.) can fill these in AFTER requirements
	*note: fill in series consecutively or using AFTER variable (E.g. 21B comes AFTER 21A).

Data needed:
Class name, quarters offered, prereqs, interest group, what should come directly after (if anything), what majors the class is required for (within math dept.)
